             <h4> Overview </h4>
             <p>XYZprinting is a world-leading 3D printing brand who had a very low product registration rate due to a complicated setup process. I was tasked with the job of analyzing and optimizing the product set up process with the hope of increasing the product registration rate. The result is a streamlined installation process that enables users to quickly create an account, login and register their printers. XYZprinting eshop sales also greatly increased as a result of a marketing/design change, creating value for both XZYprinting and our customers.  </p>

            <p>I facilitated communication between UX, marketing, software, digital marketing and customer service departments to breakdown the customer journey, undertake user research, manage and implement a marketing campaign and helped create a specification for changing the software.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Problem / Opportunity</h4>
            <p>In 2018 only 50% of XYZprinting products were registered. This highlighted an issue with our product setup and installation flow. Registration should be a short step during setup but because it was managed by multiple departments, no one was willing to take responsibility to speed up the process. The advantages of having registered customers are that customer service can more effectively process their issues and marketing could better communicate with them using product-specific marketing content.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Design Challenge</h4>
            <p>How can we encourage current and new users to register their printers and continue to use our service?</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>We decided to address the problem in two phases. The first phase, quicker to implement, was to better communicate the advantages of registering the product and offer an incentive to current users to register. The second phase, required collaboration from UX, software, marketing and cloud teams to simplify product setup and account and product registration. </p>
