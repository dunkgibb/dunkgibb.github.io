  <h3>SC&T</h3>
  <h4>Remote TV wall management system</h4>
  <br>
<p> SC&T is a networking equipment manufacturer based in Taiwan who were developing a remote TV wall management system to be used with existing network infrastructure in large shopping malls and stadiums. Working with a product owner and software developer I designed a mobile app and computer software for network administrators to manage advertising content on multiple TV walls and monitors connected to a network.  </p>

           <div class = "col-sm-12 col-md-8">




            <h4>Problem </h4>
            <p>Building administrators had trouble installing and managing content on a range of screens and variety of sources. Existing TV wall solutions only had a limited amount of arrangements for setup. Customers wanted more flexibility when installing these systems. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Opportunity</h4>
            <p>Create a content management tool that allows network administrators and shop managers to schedule, view and quickly change content on multiple screens.</p>



            <br>


            <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>We created a desktop application that allowed for easy setup and management of multiple devices connected to a network using SC&T hardware.   </p>

    <h5>Verifying the issue</h5>
    <p>A check of historical data and found in 2017 only 62% of customers register their 3D printers, in 2018 this number had dropped to 58%. We decided to make this our key metric.
    </p>

<h5>Idea generation</h5>
    <p>I kicked off the project by running a workshop to create empathy maps and map the customer journey based on some of our previous user interviews.  This allowed all the different stakeholders to brainstorm ideas about how to increase the registration rate and to see where we could “nudge” users to register their printers.</p>

<h5>Things I learnt</h5>
<p>I also included Google analytics data on our demographics for people to reference when creating the empathy map. I realized this was a mistake after a colleague from the marketing department mentioned that the data matched their advertising target demographic. Classic chicken or the egg problem. Were these people genuinely interested in our products or had they arrived via our advertising on Facebook?</p>

    <h5>Justifying the solution</h5>
  <p>Once we had created a customer journey map we found that there was no onboarding flow that spanned unboxing and software setup. Perhaps there was some way to encourage account setup and printer registration during onboarding?</p>
  <p>Here is a quote from a user that this insight was based around. During setup, his primary focus was making sure the printer worked and spent precious time searching for a test model to quickly make sure the printer worked. This really highlighted for us a gap in the flow where we could also improve the product registration rate.</p>

<p>We broke the project into two phases. The first phase would be a quick fix with an incentive and a small change to the software setup sequence. This was important to fix before our Christmas rush and to encourage people who already owned printers to register them.</p>

  <div class="col-lg">
    <h5>Phase One -  Band-aid solution </h5>
  <p>We settled on informing users the benefits of printer registration and also by offering a $10 discount voucher to encourage them to use our Eshop. This should also bump our sales in the future because users will be familiar with where to order.</p>

    <h5>Phase Two  - Improving the registration flow  </h5>
  <p>The second phase is to break down the whole onboarding process and make printer registration as seamless as possible. By doing this during onboarding we hypothesized that we would able to encourage most users to register their products. Below is a rough draft of the printer registration flow. I wanted to make the registration process as smooth as possible and minimize unneeded steps.

     <h4>Outcomes</h4>
     <p>This design was used to successfully get buy-in from other teams and a similar flow has been implemented in XYZmaker Suite resulting in the registration rate increasing by 36% when compared to the previous year.</p>
