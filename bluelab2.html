  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>Bluelab is a leading manufacturer and exporter of water measurement equipment for the horticultural industry based in Tauranga, New Zealand. Together with two engineers and a product marketer, I designed a range of handheld water testing devices for hobby gardeners in Europe and the US who were growing at indoors or in greenhouses. There was a demand for a reliable, intuitive and mobile water testing product and service that would guide users through the water testing process. I conducted user research, generated concept sketches, prototyped ideas, sourced components and helped improve manufacturing processes on the production line for this product.
The result is a range of products that have been on the market since 2012 and has a 4+ star rating on Amazon. Sales from the “pens” also contributed to Bluelab winning the 2012 BNZ Bay of Plenty export awards. </p>

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>Hobby gardeners in Europe and America new to hydroponic indoor growing were using cheap water testing equipment that would start to give unreliable readings after several months of use. These products were hard to use indoors because the font size on the LCD screens was small and hadn’t been designed for reading in low-light conditions and they only had one or two buttons to perform three tasks: calibration, water testing, and change measurement units. After interviewing users and the US sales team we found that people were not aware that the probes needed to be cleaned and stored in clean saline solution after use. This meant that the delicate sensors would only last a couple of months before giving inaccurate readings.  The products would then be thrown away and a new product purchased.
  </p>
<br>
<h3>Opportunity</h3>
<p>At the time Bluelab’s products didn’t meet the needs of these consumers,  their products were too expensive and bulky for home use, users were opting instead to buy the cheaper water testing products that would fail after several months of use.

There was an opportunity to add value by designing a product that could be used intuitively in low-light conditions and would encourage users to care for their equipment, but still be rugged enough to withstand the harsh conditions of a greenhouse.

Also by offering a low-cost water testing product, shops in EU and the US would be able to offer Bluelab’s entire product suite. This would allow shops to solely stock Bluelab water testing equipment and occupy more storefront space.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>We designed three different products for three different applications. These were soil pH measurement, water pH measurement, and water conductivity. To keep inventory costs low and make NZ manufacturing competitive, we designed parts and manufacturing processes that could be used across all three products.  We included short vital information about sensor maintenance on the product label so users could quickly learn how to clean their sensors. The LCD screen font size was enlarged and backlit to make it more accessible to users and able to be read in low-light.</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>“ An excellent pH pen! It has powerful, speedy and accurate computing with a user-friendly interface. The difference between a quality Bluelab pen and cheaper option is noticeable immediately in use and design.” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R61RO3ZCJNLNK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005POOJHG">Amazon Customer</a>  </p>

<p>“Best PH pens on the market! Use all of the different meters from Bluelab on our farm and they work amazing! Super reliable, completely submersible, and super accurate as long as you keep storage solution in the pen.” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NGDI698R6XUU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005POOJHG">Amazon Customer</a> </p>

<h1>Approach</h1>
<br>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Connecting with users to gain feedback was difficult. Products were being sold to retailers via distributors in the US and EU. This made it hard to connect with users. I was able to interview users in NZ and talk to various sales reps in the US but it would have been better to talk to a wider range of users.
We were a small team with a limited budget under time constraints to bring this product to the market. We had never developed a product like this before and encountered a lot of issues during development. Luckily the NZ product development community is really supportive and we received a lot of help from specialists when we encountered issues like leaking waterproof seals.
