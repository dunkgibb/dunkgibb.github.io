<h1>Streamling product registration</h1>
<p>A quest to convince product marketers and upper management that we are all on the same team</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Background</h4>

<p>XYZprinting is a 3D printing brand based in Taiwan that distributes globally through online retailers such as Amazon. When users receive products via Amazon, unboxing and product setup are often their first contact with the XYZprinting brand. This onboarding experience was complicated and as a result very few users registered their products.  I led a project to optimize the onboarding experience and encourage customers to register their products during setup.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Problems</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Until a product is registered, XYZprinting has no way to open a direct communication channel or gain accurate usage statistics. </li>
  <li>The product setup flow was managed by multiple departments and overly complicated for users</li>
  <li>No clear incentive for customers to register their products during setup</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Opportunities</h4>

<p>By increasing registration rates and simplifying the flow we could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve customer experience</li>
  <li>Shorten customer service response time by quickly identifying registered products</li>
  <li>Gain more accurate usage statistics</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">The Result</h4>
<p>Multiple departments collaborated to streamline the product setup and registration process. This increased the product registration by 36% and laid the foundation for more interdepartmental cooperation on future projects.</p>

<div class="container width-control py-2  ">

<h2>The Approach</h2>
<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Initial Research</h4>

<p>Three users were shadowed unboxing a product and the issues they encountered were documented and sorted based on the NNG’s usability heuristics. We found that 31% of issues occurred during setup, most of them critical.</p>
<img src="img\Rego\Usability Heuristics.PNG" class="img-fluid case-study" alt="Responsive image">

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Agreeing on the problem</h4>
<p>I met with department heads and discussed the issues around product setup and product registration. Everyone agreed that it needed to be improved but had different ideas on how to do that.</p>
<p>To align the teams, I ran a empathy map and user journey workshop with multiple departments to find ways to improve the experience. This helped everyone prioritize solutions that would have the most impact.</p>
<img src="img\Rego\Workshop.jpg" class="img-fluid case-study" alt="Responsive image">

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Course of action</h4>
<p>
Once we had created a customer journey map we found that there was no onboarding flow that spanned unboxing and software setup.

</p>
<p>We decided to implement the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incentivize users to register their existing printers</li>
<li>Improve the product registration flow  </li>
</ul>
<img src="img\Rego\CustomerJourney.jpg" class="img-fluid case-study mt-4" alt="Responsive image">

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Finding something to measure</h4>
<p>There wasn’t a lot of data available to quantify an improvement in the onboarding experience. Information needed to calculate the registration rate was collected by two different departments making it hard to accurately see the monthly registration rate. I got both data sets and calculated that in 2017 only 62% of customers registered their 3D printers, in 2018 this number had dropped to 58%. We would use the monthly registration rate to track if the design changes worked. </p>


<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Incentivizing registration</h4>
<p>We settled on informing users the benefits of printer registration and also by offering a $10 discount voucher to encourage them to use our Eshop. This should also bump our sales in the future because users will be familiar with where to make repeat purchases.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Improving the registration flow</h4>
<p>I broke down the whole onboarding process and make printer registration as seamless as possible. By doing this during onboarding we hypothesized that we would be able to encourage most users to register their products.</p>
<p>I prototyped the new flow in Figma to make it easier to get buy-in from all departments.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Outcomes</h4>
<p>This design was used to successfully get buy-in from other teams and a similar flow has been implemented in XYZmaker Suite resulting in the registration rate increasing by 36% when compared to the previous year.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Something I learnt</h4>
<p>I included Google analytics data on our demographics for people to reference when creating the empathy map. I realized this was a mistake after a colleague from the marketing department mentioned that the data matched their advertising target demographic. Classic chicken or the egg problem. Were these people genuinely interested in our products or had they arrived via our advertising on Facebook?</p>
