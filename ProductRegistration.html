  <h3>XYZprinting</h3>
  <h4>Streamlining product registration</h4>
  <br>
<p> XYZprinting is a 3D printing brand based in Taiwan that distributes globally through online retailers such as Amazon.  In 2018 I led a project to encourage customers to register their products during setup.  I successfully coordinated a marketing campaign and made changes to the product installation flow that increased the user registration rate by 36% that year.   </p>
</div>


    <div class="container">
        <div class= "row">
           <div class = "col-sm-12 col-md-8">




            <h4>Problem </h4>
            <p>Until a product is registered, XYZprinting has no way to open a direct communication channel or gain accurate usage statistics.  The product setup flow was managed by multiple departments and there was no clear incentive for customers to register their products during setup. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Opportunity</h4>
            <p>Streamlining the registration flow could provide customers with a better experience during setup and when contacting the service department, giving xyzprinting more accurate usage statistics at the same time.</p>



            <br>


            <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>Collaboration  with multiple departments to streamline the product setup and registration process and design of a marketing campaign to encourage new and existing customers to register their products.  </p>

    <h5>Verifying the issue</h5>
    <p>A check of historical data and found in 2017 only 62% of customers register their 3D printers, in 2018 this number had dropped to 58%. We decided to make this our key metric.
    </p>

<h5>Idea generation</h5>
    <p>I kicked off the project by running a workshop to create empathy maps and map the customer journey based on some of our previous user interviews.  This allowed all the different stakeholders to brainstorm ideas about how to increase the registration rate and to see where we could “nudge” users to register their printers.</p>

<h5>Things I learnt</h5>
<p>I also included Google analytics data on our demographics for people to reference when creating the empathy map. I realized this was a mistake after a colleague from the marketing department mentioned that the data matched their advertising target demographic. Classic chicken or the egg problem. Were these people genuinely interested in our products or had they arrived via our advertising on Facebook?</p>

    <h5>Justifying the solution</h5>
  <p>Once we had created a customer journey map we found that there was no onboarding flow that spanned unboxing and software setup. Perhaps there was some way to encourage account setup and printer registration during onboarding?</p>
  <p>Here is a quote from a user that this insight was based around. During setup, his primary focus was making sure the printer worked and spent precious time searching for a test model to quickly make sure the printer worked. This really highlighted for us a gap in the flow where we could also improve the product registration rate.</p>

<p>We broke the project into two phases. The first phase would be a quick fix with an incentive and a small change to the software setup sequence. This was important to fix before our Christmas rush and to encourage people who already owned printers to register them.</p>

    <h5>Phase One -  Band-aid solution </h5>
  <p>We settled on informing users the benefits of printer registration and also by offering a $10 discount voucher to encourage them to use our Eshop. This should also bump our sales in the future because users will be familiar with where to order.</p>

    <h5>Phase Two  - Improving the registration flow  </h5>
  <p>The second phase is to break down the whole onboarding process and make printer registration as seamless as possible. By doing this during onboarding we hypothesized that we would able to encourage most users to register their products. Below is a rough draft of the printer registration flow. I wanted to make the registration process as smooth as possible and minimize unneeded steps.

     <h4>Outcomes</h4>
     <p>This design was used to successfully get buy-in from other teams and a similar flow has been implemented in XYZmaker Suite resulting in the registration rate increasing by 36% when compared to the previous year.</p>
