<h1>The New Zealand Experience</h1>
<p>Exploring the New Zealand tourist experience from a Taiwanese perspective</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Introduction</h4>

<p>Tourism contributes significantly to New Zealand's economy and also promotes the NZ brand internationally.  As an industry that contributes <a href="https://www.tourismnewzealand.com/about/about-the-tourism-industry/">$15.9 billion to GDP</a> , (6.1%), it is important that we measure and improve the way tourists perceive New Zealand.</p>
<p>Tourists from different countries experience NZ differently. Cultural norms, language,  all affect how visitors interact with NZ.  Reports by Tourism New Zealand found that Chinese visitors and other key asian markets <a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/fedce7750c/visitor-experience-report.pdf">satisfaction scores</a>  were lower than that of other western countries. </p>
<p>
Satisfaction scores provide solid qualitative data that can be measured over time to see how NZ is performing. Unfortunately they do not address the “Why”.  What is it about the kiwi experience that makes these satisfaction scores lower and what does their experience look like?
</p>
<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Purpose of this research</h4>

<p>This research documents the Taiwanese experience using design research methodology and provides readers with an insight into the issues that non-native English speakers face when visiting NZ.  It also identifies areas of the visitor experience that require more research in order to be further understood,  and addressed.   This research can be used as an example of how we can better understand tourist experiences and provide examples of ways to “design” better services. </p>






<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Scope</h4>

<p>The number  of Taiwanese visitors to NZ each year is growing. Between the 2018 tourist year and 2019, visitors from <a href="https://figure.nz/chart/OKocuHuEkwLrVMPU-6hHYsx2D70cOFk24">Taiwan increased by 27%</a>. Taiwan is also culturally similar to China. Chinese mandarin is Taiwan’s national language, and a majority of Taiwanese are of Han descent.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.tourismnewzealand.com/media/3418/china-visitor-information.pdf">Of the 303,000 Chinese tourists that came to NZ in 2018</a>, 55% of them were independent professionals aged 24 - 55.  Although our research participants are Taiwanese, they share similar characteristics culturally with this demographic. Insights drawn from this research could be tested in further studies looking into Chinese tourists experience here.</p>

<p>This research was  self funded  and addresses  the Taiwanese experience only.  Further research would include  New Zealand stakeholders such as immigration personnel, tourism owner/operators, hospitality industry and restaurant owners and staff, in order to present their experience of the same visitor group.

<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Research Methods</h4>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
      <img src="img\Research\Interviews.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
        <h5 class="miniheading pt-2">Taiwan Traveller Interviews</h5>
      <p>Conducted five 1 on 1 interviews with people who had travelled overseas to learn about their travel and gift-giving motivations. </p>

      <h5 class="miniheading pt-2">Line Group Diary Study </h5>
      <p>The journey was planned in Line, a chat app that is popular in Taiwan and Japan. Participants had a group chat where everyone posted images and participants could ask questions prior to arriving. </p>

      <img src="img\Research\Post travel.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <h5 class="miniheading pt-2">Post Travel Interviews</h5>
      <p>Participants were interviewed at the end of the trip, before returning to Taiwan,  to learn what areas of the NZ experience they didn’t like and what areas of that experience could be improved. Follow up interviews with selected questions were conducted three months later, by phone. </p>

<h2 class="mt-5 mb-2 ">KEY FINDINGS</h2>


<h4 class="pt-4">Connectedness is Important </h4>

<p>Line is a popular messaging app in Taiwan and Japan and has similar functionality to China’s WeiXin. It serves as a messaging app, displays current news, and has its own digital payment system.<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/295611/taiwan-social-network-penetration/"> 84% of people in Taiwan</a> have this app on their phone</p>
<p>Prior to arriving, participants purchased SIM cards in Taiwan so when they arrived they could immediately use the Internet and didn’t waste precious holiday time trying to set up Internet in with confusing English instructions. </p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption mt-2">Participants talking to their Grandma via Line at Pak’N’Save</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Main functions of Line:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Instantly share with family members your experience </li>
  <li>Let family members know you are safe and contactable</li>
  <li>Easy place to share links and booking details</li>
  <li>Discuss where to eat dinner</li>
  <li>Provide record of who spent what</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="pt-4">Local Time vs Tourist Time</h4>
<p>Throughout the trip participants operated to a different schedule to New Zealanders. Participants expected to be able to shop after dinner, a common activity in Taiwan. In all areas we visited except for Queenstown, the shops were closed and participants didn’t really know what to do. When the shops were open during the day, we were busy doing tourist activities and didn’t have time to explore the shops. </p>

  <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Gifts - essential for workplace relationships
</h4>

<p>In China and Taiwan gift giving is an important ritual that happens when people come back from holiday or an overseas business trips. The types of gifts that are purchased and motivations for buying differ when giving to family, workmates and friends. Through the trip we went to various souvenir shops but a bulk of the presents were purchased in Auckland at either a supermarket or a souvenir shop before flying back to Taiwan. </p>

<img src="img\Research\Shopping.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="Responsive image">

<p class="pt-3"><b>Personal Gifts</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Local products that aren’t necessarily well known</li>
    <li>NZ made clothing, beauty or health products</li>
  </ul>

<div class="highlight">
    <p class="text-center quote pb-4 pt-4">“I didn’t gift honey because it was expensive. I can only use it for myself not as a gift” </p>
</div>



    <p class="pt-3"><b>Gifts for Workmates</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Help to build up relationships with colleagues</li>
            <li>Can be seen as a kind of favour</li>
        <li>Internationally recognized brands</li>
        <li>Packaging needs to look expensive</li>
      </ul>

<div class="highlight">
  <p class="text-center quote px-2 py-2 pb-4 pt-4">"Half of my gifts aren’t for me, they’re for my workmates. Some gave me money, some I’ll give as a gift.”  </p>

</div>

<div class="highlight">
  <p class="text-center quote pb-4 pt-4"> “If I give workmates a gift, next time I ask for help it’ll be easier”  </p>

</div>


      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Information Overload </h4>

      <p class="pt-3"><b>Unspoken Rules</b></p>
      <p>Restaurants and cafes have a lot of unspoken rules that influence the overall experience of dining. When walking into some restaurants participants didn’t know whether to wait for a seat or sit down directly. Payment was also another hard thing to understand. Sometimes you need to pay first other restaurants you pay later. All these rules resulted in a feeling of inconsistency which has a large sway in the perceived value of a meal.</p>
      <img src="img\Research\Deciphering Menus.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="Responsive image">

      <p class="pt-5"><b>Deciphering Menus</b></p>
      <p>Restaurant menus in New Zealand rely heavily on text to describe the dish. For a non-native English speaker, it is hard to read all the dishes and decide on what to order, especially while a waiter is close by. Participants often used their phone to google the dishes before choosing what to order.  </p>
      <img src="img\Research\Hard to understand Menus.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="Responsive image">


      <div class="highlight mt-5 px-2 py-1">
      <h4 class="mt-3 mb-2">How Might We:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li> Create safer areas at night in small towns for travellers</li>
      <li>Breakdown language barriers when eating at restaurants</li>
      <li>Design menus that can be read easily by non-native English speakers</li>
  <li>Help tourists to find nighttime activities that meet their expectations</li>
<li>Look at shopping as an activity you experience and not as a simple monetary transaction</li>

<li> Make souvenirs that are designed for giving to workmates</li>

    </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="container impact-title mt-5" style="height:1px;">
      </div>



      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4 ">NEXT STEPS</h2>
      <p>This research resulted in some really interesting findings but also highlighted a lack of awareness of tourists experiences in New Zealand.</p> <p>Moving forward we need to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Understand the whole picture - different countries, tourist operators, NZ citizens.</li>
        <li>Interview Chinese tourists and find similarities and differences when compared to Taiwanese tourists</li>
        <li>Share findings and HWM questions with tourism industry to start discussion about how to improve the NZ experience for Taiwanese.</li>
      </ul>
