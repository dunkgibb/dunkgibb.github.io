  <h3>Bluelab Pen Series</h3>
  <h4>Compact water testing equipment for indoor gardening</h4>
  <br>
<p>Bluelab is a leading manufacturer and exporter of water measurement equipment for the horticultural industry based in Tauranga, New Zealand. Together with two engineers and a product marketer, I designed a range of handheld water testing devices for hobby gardeners in Europe and the US who were growing at indoors or in greenhouses. There was a demand for a reliable, intuitive and mobile water testing product and service that would guide users through the water testing process. I conducted user research, generated concept sketches, prototyped ideas, sourced components and helped improve manufacturing processes on the production line for this product. The result is a range of products that have been on the market since 2012 and has a 4+ star rating on Amazon. Sales from the “pens” also contributed to Bluelab winning the 2012 BNZ Bay of Plenty export awards.  </p>

            <h4>Problem </h4>
            <p>Hobby gardeners in Europe and America new to hydroponic indoor growing were using cheap water testing equipment that would start to give unreliable readings after several months of use. These products were hard to use indoors because the font size on the LCD screens was small and hadn’t been designed for reading in low-light conditions and they only had one or two buttons to perform three tasks: calibration, water testing, and change measurement units. After interviewing users and the US sales team we found that people were not aware that the probes needed to be cleaned and stored in clean saline solution after use. This meant that the delicate sensors would only last a couple of months before giving inaccurate readings.  The products would then be thrown away and a new product purchased.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Opportunity</h4>
            <p>At the time Bluelab’s products didn’t meet the needs of these consumers,  their products were too expensive and bulky for home use, users were opting instead to buy the cheaper water testing products that would fail after several months of use.</p>

              <p>There was an opportunity to add value by designing a product that could be used intuitively in low-light conditions and would encourage users to care for their equipment, but still be rugged enough to withstand the harsh conditions of a greenhouse.
              </p>

            <br>


            <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>We designed three different products for three different applications. These were soil pH measurement, water pH measurement, and water conductivity. To keep inventory costs low and make NZ manufacturing competitive, we designed parts and manufacturing processes that could be used across all three products.  We included short vital information about sensor maintenance on the product label so users could quickly learn how to clean their sensors. The LCD screen font size was enlarged and backlit to make it more accessible to users and able to be read in low-light.</p>

     <h4>Impact</h4>
     <p> “ An excellent pH pen! It has powerful, speedy and accurate computing with a user-friendly interface. The difference between a quality Bluelab pen and cheaper option is noticeable immediately in use and design. ” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R61RO3ZCJNLNK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005POOJHG"></a> Amazon Customer</p>
    <p>“ Best PH pens on the market! Use all of the different meters from Bluelab on our farm and they work amazing! Super reliable, completely submersible, and super accurate as long as you keep storage solution in the pen. ” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NGDI698R6XUU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005POOJHG"></a>Amazon Customer </p>

      <h5>User interviews</h5>
      <p>I interviewed overseas sales representatives and visited growers in NZ to see how they added fertilizer to the growing medium and did water testing.
      I then reviewed all the insights from this research and separated it into the following groups to design around:

      <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Group</th>
              <th>Description  </th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>pH education</td>
              <td>There was a need to educate users about how to clean and store the sensors in the product.</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Price range</td>
              <td>Since the product was being manufactured in New Zealand design for low cost manufacturing and quick assembly would have to be considered.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Product warranty</td>
              <td>Bluelab offers warranties on all their products. The product design would need to well surpass the stated product warranty.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Intuitiveness</td>
              <td>The product interface would need to suit beginners and industry experts alike. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Product storage</td>
              <td>When not in use, there would need to be some way to easily store the product and sensors. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Product cleaning</td>
              <td>The product would make cleaning the sensors as easy as possible.  </td>
            </tr>

          </tbody>
        </table>

  <h5>Initial concepts</h5>
  <p>I used the insight groups from the user interviews to generate various concepts that I presented to the company CEO and workmates from different departments.  </p>

  <h5>Prototyping</h5>
  <p>I then generated paper and foam prototypes of the concepts to show participants from the research phase to get feedback. </p>

<h5>UI Flow</h5>
<p>The process was iterated several times before we finalized the UI and generated a CAD model. </p>

<h5>Tooling CAD Model</h5>
<p>As a final check before tooling, we created a final render and SLA 3D printed the CAD model and assembled the sample LCD and PCB to double check part tolerances. </p>
